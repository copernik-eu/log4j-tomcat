Due to Tomcat's complex classloader architecture (cf. https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-10.1-doc/class-loader-howto.html[Class Loader How-TO]), the Copernik.eu extensions for Log4j and Tomcat has been split into three artifacts.
This way each of them can be deployed in a different classloader:

* The `tomcat-juli-to-log4j` artifact needs to be in the same classloader as `tomcat-juli`: the _system_ classloader.
* The `tomcat-log4j` artifact needs to be in the same classloader as the Tomcat server classes: the _common_ or _server_ classloaders.
* The `log4j-tomcat` artifact needs to be in the same classloader as Log4j Core.
Depending on the deployment, this might be the _system_, _common_ or _webapp_ classloader.

[#tomcat-juli-to-log4j]
== `tomcat-juli-to-log4j`

The `tomcat-juli-to-log4j` artifact provides a bridge between Tomcat JUL and Log4j API.

See xref:components/tomcat-juli-to-log4j.adoc[] for more details.

[#tomcat-log4j]
== `tomcat-log4j`

The `tomcat-log4j` artifact provides Tomcat components that improve its usage with Log4j.

See xref:components/tomcat-log4j.adoc[] for more details.

[#log4j-tomcat]
== `log4j-tomcat`

The `log4j-tomcat` artifact provides Log4j Core plugins that extend the possibility of the logging backend by providing Tomcat-specific functionalities.

See xref:components/log4j-tomcat.adoc[] for more details.
