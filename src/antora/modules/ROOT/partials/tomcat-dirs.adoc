.Click here for a definition of `CATALINA_BASE` and `CATALINA_HOME`
[%collapsible]
====
A Tomcat installation can be split in two separate folders:

`CATALINA_HOME`:: This is the folder that contains the code of the server and the default configuration of Tomcat instances.

`CATALINA_BASE`:: This is the folder that contains the runtime configuration and working directories of a specific Tomcat instance.

The typical location of these folders varies between OSes:

Debian::
+
On Debian and derived GNU/Linux distributions `CATALINA_BASE` is located in the `/var/lib` folder (e.g. `/var/lib/tomcat{tomcat-major-version}`).
`CATALINA_HOME` on the other hand is located in `/usr/share` (e.g. `/usr/share/tomcat{tomcat-major-version}`).

Windows::
+
If you installed Tomcat from the MSI package, both `CATALINA_BASE` and `CATALINA_HOME` point to the same subfolder of `C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation`, e.g. `C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation/Tomcat {tomcat-minor-version}`.
